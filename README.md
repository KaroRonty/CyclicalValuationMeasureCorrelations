# CyclicalValuationMeasureCorrelations
Correlation analysis of cyclically adjusted valuation measures (CAPE, CAPD and CAPB) and subsequent returns.
Outputs csv files containing the correlations for each measurement and formation periods.
Also outputs plots showing the r-squared of each valuation measure for each measurement and formation period.
